            <p>I've been reading a lot lately and this re-kindled my love for writing. For so long, I've been meaning to
                start a self-hosted blog. A blog is a better place, I think, for longer and more structured writings.
                For the rest of the updates, Twitter¹ would be my go-to platform.</p>
            <p>None of the options I considered for a blogging solutions could bought me into using them and hence I
                wanted to try creating my own blogging solution.</p>
            <p>From the first minute, I knew roughly what I wanted: a clean WYSIWYG interface with the aesthetics of
                physical print books. I wanted: a paper.</p>
            <p>A digital paper where what you write would be exactly the same with what people would see. After a few
                hours of web development² work, here we are:</p>
            <p>You are looking³ at the very first version of Paper.</p>
            <p>Before publishing, a page allows me to write with contenteditable attributes set, and a few js functions
                that makes it convenient for me to write without messing up the whole thing. It also uses Firestore as
                an auto save assistant.</p>
            <p>To publish a writing, though, I just save the html and upload it to the&nbsp; enabled Github Pages
                repository that backs up the blog. The css file is already there and the js files allowing me to write
                locally is not served.</p>
            <p>All of the functionality that allows me to write the page (the stationary kit if you will) stays at home
                when I publish this page in my blog. So you see the read-only end product.</p>
            <p>If I ever wanted to edit a page, I still could do it locally but I need to upload a second version to the
                repository. This also allows me to version control all my writings.</p>
            <p>Yes, some manual work is included in publishing a page, but I hope that it gets better in time with the
                upcoming versions.</p>
            <p>The first things I want to work on in Paper is related to the writing environment though: I currently
                have no ways to make a text bold, add a heading or an image.</p>
            <p>Overall, I love how this turned out to be. Hello. This is Paper.</p>
            <p>---</p>
            <p>[1] Yes I will keep calling it Twitter at least for a couple of years.<br></p>
            <p>[2] I love creating for web but for some reason I couldn't develop affection to the tools and
                environments that are used to build web apps.</p>
            <p>[3] Of course, if you are reading this post in the close to the publication date.</p>
